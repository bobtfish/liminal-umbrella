**DM contact:** <@627266856608202783>
**Brief description:** A group of Colonial Marines are tasked with the recovery of a dangerous cargo on a world brimming with insurrection
**Session Notes:**  I'm planning this one in advance since it's more of a time commitment.

The shorthand version:
- Alien RPG is a tabletop RPG based on the Alien series, where players can expect to scream and have no one hear them
    - Very newbie friendly.  The YZ system Alien RPG is based on can be taught in minutes and I've run a lot of newbie sessions
- You need nothing but imagination to play this.  I'll handle the rest.
- Veteran space truckers and tough hombres/chicas welcome

I am going to rewrite the campaign a little to allow people to be able to duck in and out as they need to, since it's longer and less confined than the previous campaign.  However it'd still be nice to get a core group who like playing these types of games.
**On Me:**  I'm a DM with around half a decade or so experience who has run extensive campaigns before for previous clubs and ran Alien RPG here before.  I have ADHD and ASD so I'm a little scatterbrained at times, but I've learnt to make it work to my advantage ðŸ™‚
