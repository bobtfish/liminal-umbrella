Brief description: Currently working out most details as these need to be discussed ideally at the session zero for the game. Ideally, will run once per month, maybe twice if I can manage that while doing an OU course. No set date on a start as I'm waiting for Harlequins' nwe location to be up and running. Any details I have managed to pin down will be in my own Discord server, feel free to message me for the invite link. I keep everything there for reasons that I've posted elsewhere on this server :)
