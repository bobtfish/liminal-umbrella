Brief description:
Prison of the Hated Pretender is an introductory adventure for 4-5 characters
*A sculpted tower's blank eyes stare down from the lonely dry hills beyond the last withered turnip fields, the doorway in its eternally screaming mouth beckoning daredevils and foolish fortune hunters.  Haunted, shunned and anathema -- spending a night in The Prison of the Hated Pretender will certainly give you bragging rights in the coast's dusty hamlets, and if the rumors of ancient gold within are true enough to buy passage to a less wretched land.*

[Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/) is a free fantasy RPG about exploring a dark & mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, classless, and relies on fictional advancement rather than through XP or level mechanics. It is based on Knave by Ben Milton and Into The Odd by Chris McDowall.
